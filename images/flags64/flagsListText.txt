I know everyone’s busy with their games but if you’ve ever written a newspaper
article before or can write structured texts of any kind I’m looking for 
someone to write a news article styled text to be displayed at the end of my game.

Requirements:

150 words describing the unclear events surrounding a space shuttle crash and its
impact on the nation, as well as a reflection on the tragedy of the loss of the entire international crew and Bucky, the beloved space hamster. 

Written in a somber, factual tone. 

Please respond privately to my slack profile by 1pm if you want to do this before 8pm tonight. 

Rewards include credit in the game and maybe a non-GA coffee.
